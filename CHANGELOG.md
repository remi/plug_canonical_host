# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

Since it is a boilerplate project, there are technically no official (versioned) _releases_. Therefore, the `master` branch should always be stable and usable.

## v2.0.3

- Downgrade `earmark` to make CI build pass with older Elixir versions

## v2.0.2

- Upgrade `ex_doc` and `earmark` to fix raw HTML in documentation

## v2.0.1

- Fix various warnings for Elixir 1.11 (#19, thanks @gcauchon!)

## v2.0.0

- Remove `ignore` since the same behaviour is achievable with a simple Plug setup.

## Previous versions

See `git log` for a complete history. Sorry about that.
